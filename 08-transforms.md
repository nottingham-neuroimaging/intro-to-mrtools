# Transforms, more on alignments

## Background

:books: Before reading on here, I strongly suggest you read the [coordinate transforms tutorial](http://gru.stanford.edu/doku.php/mrtools/coordinatetransforms) on Justin Gardner's webpage. This explains in excellent detail how coordinate transforms work and how they are handled in `mrTools`.

Below, I will try to break down the linear algebra a bit more with a worked example. We'll use 2d images to start, as this makes creating diagrams and plots a bit easier -- but the principles apply in 3d, too.
